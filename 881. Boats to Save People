# You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, 
# and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. 
# Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.
# Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.

# Example 1:
# Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)

# Example 2:
# Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

Sort the array, and point i and j at the beginning and at the end of the array.
