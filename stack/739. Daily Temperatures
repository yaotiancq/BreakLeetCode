# Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array 
# answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
# If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

# Example 1:
# Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
# Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
