# You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:
# arr.length >= 3
# There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
# arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
# arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
# Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.

# Example 1:
# Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.


"""
Find the top of mountain and loop from there. Find the left edge and right edge of mountain.
