# Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. 
# If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

# For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:
# The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

# Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

# Custom Judge:

# The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

# intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
# listA - The first linked list.
# listB - The second linked list.
# skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
# skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
# The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. 
# If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.
